# roullete-game
In this project I implemented a Roulette multiplayer game on the console. The programming language which I used is Java and I developed the project in Eclipse.

Rules of the game:  

Each player needs a name read from console but two players cannot have the same name. When a player connects he will receive a confirmation message. The program checks if it is unique. 

The target of the game is for the player to win as much money as possible.  
Each player starts with 100$. When all the money is lost he will be eliminated. Each turn a player can bet any integer amount between 1$ and 10$.   

Players can choose different types of bets:
•	Single – bet on single number
•	Split – bet on two vertically/horizontally adjacent number (e.g. 14-17 or 8-9)
•	Street – bet on three consecutive numbers in a horizontal line (e.g. 7-8-9)
•	Corner – bet on four numbers that meet at one corner (e.g. 10-11-13-14)
•	Rouge – bet that the number will be red
•	Pair – bet that the number will be pair

The table will be using the european (or french) layout: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Roulette_table_layout
